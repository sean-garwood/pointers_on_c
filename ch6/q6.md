# Chapter 6 questions

1. If the type of a value cannot be determined by looking at its bits, how does
   the machine know how the value should be implemented?

    The implementation of the value is defined by the operator that is acting
    upon it. For instance, if

    ```c

    int a = 22;
    float b = 7.0;

    a / b
    ```

    the result is a `float` that is approximately equal to pi; the compiler promotes
    `a` to a `float`.

5. diff between work required to evaluate expressions a and b?

```c
int     i[10];
int     *p = &i[0];
int     offset; // assume value of three

p += offset;    //a
p += 3;         //b
```

expression a does more work: has to retrieve value of `offset` and a pointer
plus an int is a pointer. Expression b does the same thing by storing `&i[3]` in
`p`, but the integer value 3 is directly included rather than retrieved. This
also results in smaller object code and faster runtime.

6. What is wrong with this code segment that should be setting all elements in
   `i` to 0?

```c
int     array[ARRAY_SIZE];
int     *pi;

for(pi = &array[0]; pi < &array[ARRAY_SIZE]; )
    *++pi = 0;                                  // WRONG!
```

The issue is that `array[0]` is not given a value; it could contain anything.
This is due to the fact that `pi` is dereferenced after it is incremented.

This is due to the R-L associativity of the `++` and `*` operators; `++pi` is
evaluated first. The expression increments `pi` and then dereferences and sets
the value stored at the address ref'ed by the pointer to 0.
