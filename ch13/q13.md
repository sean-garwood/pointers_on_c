## Chapter 13 questions

1. Explain the following expressions.

```c
/* key
#=> returns
p   pointer
fn  function */

int     abc();              // fn #=> int (8)
int     abc[3];             // array of three ints
int     **abc();            // fn #=> p to a p to int
int     (*abc)();           // p to a function #=> int
int     (*abc)[6];          // p to array of six integers
int     *abc();             // fn #=> p to int
int     **(*abc[6])();      // array of six ps functions
                            // #=> ps to ps to ints (whew!)
int     *(*abc[6]);         // array of six ps to ps to ints
int     *(*abc())();        // illegal
int     (**(*abc)())();     // p to fn #=> p to p to function #=> int
int     (*(*abc)())[6];     // p to fn #=> p to array of 6 ints
int     *(*(*(*abc)())[6]); // p to fn #=> p to array of 6 p to p to int
```

2. Given

```c
char     *array[10];      // array of 10 p to char
char     **ptr = array;   // pointer to pointer to array of 10 p to char
```

what is effect of adding one to `ptr`?

we are storing the rvalue of the expression `array` into a variable that is a
pointer to a pointer to a char. First, we determine the rvalue of array by
looking at its declaration. we see that it is an uninitialized array of 10
pointers to chars. Its r-value is the address at which the first pointer is
stored, i.e. &array[0]

adding one to `ptr` thus increments the memory address that `ptr` points to by
sizeof(&array[0]).

3. what is the type of the arg to this fn?

`void func(int ***arg);`

it's a pointer to pointer to a pointer to an int. it looks like this

arg --> ptr1 --> ptr2 --> int arg_value;

4. how to improve this code?

```c
Trx *t;

t->product->orders += 1;
t->product->qty_oh -= t->qty;
t->product->supplier->reorder_qty += t->qty;
if (t->product->restricted) {
  // blah blah blah
}```

product belongs to a trx
supplier belongs to product
would be good to have an arg that points to a callback function
that returns a void pointer to whatever attribute of the Trx structure
that `t` points to.


also, could just define a register pointer to the product that is being evaluated
for the given transaction, i.e.

`register Product *trx_product = trx->product;`

5. Given the following:

```c
typedef struct {
  int x;
  int y;
} Point;

Point p;
Point *a = &p;
Point **b = &a;
```

determine the value of each of the following expressions:

* a
  &p
* *a
  p
* a->x
  (*(&p)).x
  p.x
* b
  &a
* b->a
  undefined
* b->x
  (&a)->x
  (*(&a)).x
  undefined
* *b
  (*(&a))
  a
* *b->a
  (*(&a))->a
  &p->a
  undefined
* *b->x
  a->x
  p.x
* b->a->x
  (&a)->(&p)->x
  (*(&a)).//...
  a.(&p)->x
  a.(*(&p)).x
  a.p.x
  (&p).p.x
  undefined
* (*b)->a
  a->a
  (*(&p)).a
  p.(&p)
  undefined
* (*b)->x
  a->x
  p.x
* **b
  **(&a)
  *a
  *(&p)
  p

6. given the following declarations:

```c
typedef struct {
  int x;
  int y;
} Point;

Point x, y; // declares x and y to be uninitialized vars of type Point which are
            // structures with two integer members: x and y.
Point *a = &x, *b = &y; // I believe that only the value of &y is stored in b
                        // here; the result from the expression `*a = &x` is
                        // evaluated, but the rvalue of &x is not stored in a.
```

explain the meaning of each of these statements:

* x = y;
  would store y in x

* a = y;
* a = b;
* a = *b;
* *a =*b;

1. Given

```c
typedef struct {
  int x;
  int y;
} Point;

Point x, y;
Point *a = &x, *b = &y;
```

Give the meaning of each statement

* x = y;

y is an uninitialized Point structure. A copy of it is stored to x

* a = y;

error: a copy of y cannot be stored in the pointer to a Point struct, a.

* a = b;

a copy of b, which is a pointer to the point structure y, is stored in a.

* a = *b;
error: the value of b, which is the value of y, ,cannot be stored in
a, since b is a pointer to a struct, and*b is a struct, and the type of a is a
pointer to a struct.

* *a =*b;

the value of y is stored in the address of a, destroying any other data there.

1. Many implementations of ANSI C include a fn called `getopt`. this fn helps
   process command line args. However, it is not mentioned in the Standard. What
   are some adv/disadv of including this?

Well, it provides a (presumably) easy way to get the command line args without
having to explicitly write out the `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`
declaration. I guess a disadvantage is it might make for a clunkier
implementation to include this in std libs, and the argc/argv is pretty
straightforward.

1. What's wrong with this code?

```c
char *pathname = "/usr/temp/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
// insert filename into pathname
strcpy(pathname + 10, "myfoofile.txt")
```

This will not overwrite the extra 'X' chars, of which there are fifteen, even
though the pointer is initialized correctly to the right place (first 'X' char)
in the pathname string. However, the null char is stored in there for the
terminator, which works for C, but might not work for some OS/whatever program
is trying to read the filename--this might not signify termination.

A safer alternative would be to append the file to the /usr/temp/ pathname after
finding its length, like

```c
const char *path_prefix = "/usr/temp/";
const char *filename = "myfoofile.txt";
int path_prefix_len = strlen(path_prefix);
int filename_len = strlen(filename);
int full_path_len = path_prefix_len + filename_len;

// Allocate enough space for the full path plus the null terminator
char *file_path = malloc(full_path_len + 1);
if (file_path == NULL) {
  // Handle memory allocation failure
  fprintf(stderr, "Failed to allocate memory for file_path\n");
}

// Construct the full file path safely
strcpy(file_path, path_prefix);
strcat(file_path, filename); // Use strcat to append the filename

// Use the file_path
printf("Full file path: %s\n", file_path);

// Free the allocated memory
free(file_path);
```

1. What is wrong with the following code fragment? how to fix?

```c
char pathname[] = "/usr/temp/";
char filename[] = "mybarfile.txt";
srcat(pathname, filename);
```

there's not enough room to store the filename in the pathname. Better to use
malloc to allow for the appropriate size array to store the pathname as above.

1. What is wrong with the following code fragment? how to fix?

```c
char pathname[20] = "/usr/temp/";
strcat(pathname, filename);
```

* `filename` is undefined
* will overflow pathname buffer if filename is >= 10 char
* use malloc as described above

1. Standard states that the effects of modifying a string literal are
   undefined. What problems might be caused if you did motify string literals?

* program crash - strings are often stored in ROM, so attempting to modify will
  cause a segfault.
* Data corruption - might overwrite data that was not supposed to be overwritten
* Inconsistent behavior - unpredictable => inconsistent
* Security vulns - Might allow execution of arbitrary code

For refresher:

## string literals

```c
char *literal_string = "foobarbaz"; // no len defined explicitly
                                    // determined at runtime

literal_string[7] = "s";            // undefined

/* better to declare as an array of chars */
char mutable_string[] = "Hiya, woild";
mutable_string[7] = "O";            // totally safe, bro

/* or, better yet, dynamically allocate memory for the string */
char *str = malloc(sizeof(char) * 14); // assuming 14 chars is max
strcpy(str, "Hiya, woild");
str[7] = "W";                          // dont forget to free up this mem
```
