# Chapter 14 questions - the preprocessor

1. The preprocessor defines the following five symbols:

   | symbol       | sample value  | description                                |
   |--------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
   | \_\_FILE\_\_ | "q14.c"       | the name of the source file                |
   | \_\_LINE\_\_ | 5             | the current line number in the source file |
   | \_\_DATE\_\_ | "Feb 23 1988" | the date the source file was compiled      |
   | \_\_TIME\_\_ | "12:00:00"    | the time the source file was compiled      |
   | \_\_STDC\_\_ | 1             | if the compiler conforms to the ANSI standard, else undefined. |

   Name a use case for each.

    FILE: can be used to print the name of the source file in the program
    output. this might be useful in a program that reads in a file and
    processes it, and you want to print the name of the file being processed.

    LINE: can be used to print the current line number in the source file
    in the program output. this might be useful in a program that reads in
    a file and processes it, and you want to print the line number of the
    file being processed.

    DATE: can be used to print the date the source file was compiled in the
    program output. this might be useful in a program that reads in a file
    and processes it, and you want to print the date the file was compiled.

    TIME: can be used to print the time the source file was compiled in the
    program output. this might be useful in a program that reads in a file
    and processes it, and you want to print the time the file was compiled.

    STDC: can be used to check if the compiler conforms to the ANSI standard.
    this might be useful in a program that uses ANSI standard features, and
    you want to check if the compiler supports them, such as in an embedded
    system where you need to ensure the compiler supports the ANSI standard.

2. Name two advantages of using `#define`d names in place of literal constants.

    1. Readability: using `#define`d names makes the code more readable
    because the names are descriptive and provide context for the values
    they represent. this makes it easier to understand the code and
    maintain it in the future.

    2. Maintainability: using `#define`d names makes the code more maintainable
    because if the value needs to be changed, it can be done in one place
    (the `#define` statement) instead of searching for all occurrences of
    the literal constant in the code. this reduces the chance of errors
    and makes it easier to update the code.

3. Write a macro for debugging that will print arbitrary expressions. It should
   be called with two arguments:

   1. `printf` format code
   2. expression to be printed

  `#define DEBUG_PRINT(fmt, expr)     (printf((fmt), (expr)))`

4. What will the following program print?

```c
#define MAX(a, b) (a) > (b) ? (a) : (b)
#define SQUARE(x) x *x
#define DOUBLE(x) x + x

main()
{
    int x, y, z;
    y = 2;
    z = 3;
    x = MAX(y, z);
    printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y, z); // a

    y = 2;
    z = 3;
    x = MAX(++y, ++z);
    printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y, z); // b

    x = 2;
    y = SQUARE(x);
    z = SQUARE(x + 6);
    printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y, z); // c

    x = 2;
    y = 3;
    z = MAX(5 * DOUBLE(x), ++y);
    printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y, z); // d

    // expand the macros to see what the program will print

    // a
    x = (y) > (z) ? (y) : (z);
    x = (2) > (3) ? (2) : (3);
    x = 3;
    // output: "3 2 3"

    // b
    x = (++2) > (++3) ? (++2) : (++3); // y and z are both incremented during
                                       // evaluation of the conditional
    x = (3) > (4) ? (++3) : (++4);     // step one: evaluate left to right
                                       // evaluate the conditional. 3 > 4 is false

    x = (++4); // step two: evaluate the right side of
               // the conditional. increment z and store
               // in x
    x = 5;     // x is now 5, as is z. y is 3.
    // output: "5 3 5"

    // c
    x = 2;
    y = x * x;
    y = 2 * 2; // y is now 4
    z = x + 6 * x + 6;
    z = 2 + 6 * 2 + 6; // z is now 20
    // output: "2 4 20" (lol)

    // d
    x = 2;
    y = 3;
    z = MAX(5 * DOUBLE(x), ++y);
    z = MAX(5 * x + x, ++y);                       // expand the DOUBLE macro
    z = (5 * x + x) > (++y) ? (5 * x + x) : (++y); // expand the MAX macro
    (5 * 2 + 2) > (++3);                           // evaluate the conditional
    12 > 4;                                        // 12 is greater than 4, so evaluate to true
    z = 12;                                        // store the result in z
    // output: "2 4 12"
}
```

5. the `putchar` function is defined in the file `stdio.h` as a macro, despite
   the fact that it is fairly long. Why do you think it was defined this way?

   `putchar` is defined as a macro in `stdio.h` because it is a simple function
   that takes a single character as an argument and writes it to the standard
   output. By defining it as a macro, the overhead of a function call can be
   avoided, which can improve performance in cases where `putchar` is called
   frequently. Additionally, defining `putchar` as a macro allows for better
   optimization by the compiler, as it can inline the code directly into the
   calling function, reducing the overhead of function call and return.

   the fact that it is putting a 1-byte character into a buffer means that type
   checking would be a waste of time, and the function is so simple that it
   would be a waste of time to call it as a function. This avoids the common
   pitfall of type-agnosticity in C macros

6. what's wrong with this program?

   ```c
   // process values in array 
   
   result = 0;
   i = 0;
   while (i < SIZE)
   {
       result += process(value[i++]);
   }
   ```

  can't really tell anything here. Depends on the def of process. If it's a
  macro, then this will incorrectly evaluate the arg becuase it uses an in-place
  increment op in its arg

7. what's wrong with this program fragment?

   ```c
   #define SUM (value)     ((value) + (value))
   int array[SIZE];
   /*
    * sum all values in the array
    */
   
   sum = 0;
   i = 0;
   while (i < SIZE)
       sum += SUM(array[i++]);
   ```

   the fact that `array[i++]` is evaluated twice in the macro means that the
   value of `array[i++]` is incremented twice every time it is passed to the
   macro. This is a problem because the value of `i` is incremented in the
   while loop, so the value of `array[i++]` is incremented twice every time
   the while loop is executed. This means that the while loop will skip every
   other element in the array, so it fails if SIZE is odd.

   Also, the dependency of having to have an incrementing operator in the
   argument to the macro means it only works for this particular while loop, and
   not a for loop that might also increment i each step, which is another common
   iteration method.

8. what's wrong with these fragments?

   ```c
   // header1.h
   #ifndef _HEADER1_H
   #define _HEADER1_H
   #include "header2.h"
   // other declarations
   #endif
   ```

   ```c
   // header2.h
   #ifndef _HEADER2_H
   #define _HEADER2_H
   #include "header1.h"
   // other declarations
   #endif
   ```

   * if either of the `_HEADER` files are defined at compile, then the other
     declarations will not be added because they are in the body of that
     conditional that checks whether they are defined. If they are, then none of
     the #ifndef ... #endif closure is executed.
   * if a file includes both header files, there will not be infinite
     recursion(?) between them, since the include guards #ifndef
   * however, if the other declarations are needed to run a program, then they
     might not be included or defined if either _HEADER si defined already.

9. In an attempt to improve portability, a programmer writes the following
   declarations:

   ```c
   #if sizeof(int) == 2
       typedef long int32;
   #else
       typedef int int32;
   #endif
   ```

   what is wrong with them?

   * looks good to me, but copi says:
    `sizeof` can't be used until compile time,
     not during preprocessing time, since the preprocessor doesn't have access
     to type sizes or the ability to evaluate expressions like `sizeof`.
