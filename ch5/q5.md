# Questions - Chapter 5

1. what is the type and value of the expression?

    (float)(25 / 10);

the parenthetical groupings have the highest priority:
    (25 / 10) = 2
    (float)2  = 2.0
Therefore, the type is `float` and value of the expression is 2.0.

2. what is the result of the following program?

```c
# include <stdio.h>
int func();

int func(void)
{
    static int counter = 1;
    return ++counter;
}

int main()
{
    int answer;
    answer = func() - func() * func();
    printf("%d\n", answer);
}
```

function calls have higher precedence than any arithmetic operator, so func()
gets called three times. It is unclear whether the order of evaluation is LTR or
RTL, so the result could be:

LTR: 2 - 3 *4 = 2 - 12 = -10
RTL: 4 - 3* 2 = 4 - 6 = -2

Let's see what happens on this machine/compiler:

```sh
$ cc q5
$ ./q5
-10
```

The result is -10, implying LTR evaluation.

3. What are some uses for bitwise and shifting operators?

They are shortcuts for certain arithmetic operations, such as multiplying or
dividing by powers of 2. They are also used to manipulate individual bits in
a byte or word. This can be useful for setting or clearing flags, or for
packing multiple values into a single variable, or for masking/salting data.

They are utilized heavily in graphics programming, cryptography, and networking.
See:

* [Bit hacks for graphics programming](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html)
* [Bitwise ops for crypto](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~dmarino/ucf/cis3362/lectures/newlecs/BitwiseOps-Crypto.pdf)

4. Is the conditional operator foraster or slower than an if statement?

it is faster. it is a single instruction, whereas an if statement is a branch
that contains at least two instructions. The conditional operator is also more
compact and easier to read, especially for simple conditions.

5. Write an assignment that sets leap_year true if `year` is a leap year.

    leap_year = (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0;

6. which operators have side effects, and what are they?

The increment and decrement operators have side effects. They modify the value
either before or after the expression is evaluated. The comma operator also has
side effects. It only returns the value of the last expression, but it evaluates
all expressions in LTR order.

7. What is the result of this fragment?

```c
int a = 20;
// ...
if (1 <= a <= 10)
    printf("a is between 1 and 10\n");
else
    printf("a is not between 1 and 10\n");
```

Easy. The expression is evaluated from LTR, so:

1 <= a evals to 1
1 <= 10 evals to 1
'a is between 1 and 10' is printed to the console, despite a not being between 1
and 10.

8. rewrite this frag to eliminate redundnancies:
    a = f1(x);
    b = f2(x + a);
    for (c = f3(a, b); c> 0; c = f3(a, b)){
        // do something
        a = f1(++x);
        b = f2(x + a);
    }

    is the same as:

    while (a = f1(x), b = f2(x + a), c = f3(a, b), c > 0)
    {
        // do something
        a = f1(++x);
        b = f2(x + a);
    }

9. Does the following loop do what it's supposed to?

nonzero = 0;
for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i +=1)
    nonzero += array[i];
if (!nonzero)
    printf("Values are all zero\n");
else
    printf("Values are not all zero\n");

No. given

```c
`int array[ARRAY_SIZE] = {-1, 0, 1};
```

this would evaluate to 0, even though the values are not all zero.
a better approach would be to use a flag:

```c
    all_zero = 1;
    for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i += 1)
    {
        if (array[i] != 0)
        {
            all_zero = 0;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (all_zero)
        printf("Values are all zero\n");
    else
        printf("Values are not all zero\n");
```

<!-- sorry this looks like shit. meh. -->
10. Given

```c
    int a = 10, b = -25;
    int c = 0, d = 3;
    int e = 20;
```

Evaluate each of the following expressions. Note any side effects. Evaluate each
in their own scope.

binary:

a =    0 1010
-b =  1 1001
b = 1..0 0111
c = 0
d = 0 0011
e = 1 0100

* b
    -25
* b++
    -25 ; b becomes -24 after the expression is evaluated
* --a
    9 ; no side effects, a is decremented and the resultant value is 9
* a / 6
    1
* b % 10
    -5
* a << 2
    a = 10  so 0b1010 << 2 = 0b101000 = 40
* b >> 3
    b = -25
    assuming 2's complement
        25 = 0b00000000 00000000 00000000 00011001
        -25 = 0b11111111 11111111 11111111 11100111
    b >> 3 = 0b11...100
    -4
* a > b
    1
* b = a
    10; b is assigned the value of a
* b == a
    0

* a & b
    a = 10 = 000...0 1010
    b = -25 = 111...0 0111

* ~b
    the ~ operator inverts all bits
    -25 = 0b11111111 11111111 11111111 11100111
    ~b = 0b00000000 00000000 00000000 00011000
    24
* c && a
    0
* c || a
    1
* b ? a : c
    a
* a += 2
    12 ; a is assigned the value 12
* b &= 20
    equivalent to b = b & 20
    20 = 0b00000000 00000000 00000000 00010100
    -25 = 0b11111111 11111111 11111111 11100111
    the only column that has two ones in it is the 5th column, so the result is
    10000 = 16 ; b is assigned the value 16
* b >>= 3
    equivalent to b = b >> 3
    0b1...1100
* a %= 6
    4 ; a is assigned the value 4
* d = a > b
    1 ; d is assigned the value 1
* a = b = c = d
    3 ; a, b, and c are all assigned the value 3
* e = d + ( c = a + b )
    e = d + (-15) ; c is assigned the value -15
    e = 3 + (-15) = -12 ; e is assigned the value -12
    -12
* etc...
* b >> a - 4
    a - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6
    b >> 6
    -1

* etc..

* a & 0x1 == b & 0x1

* a | b << a & b

    << is higher precedence than & and & is higher precedence than |
    b << a is first to be evaluated
        b = -25 = 0b11111111 11111111 11111111 11100111
        shift all the bits left by 10 yields
               0b11111111 11111111 10011100 00000000 = b << a

                                                     = 16384 + 8192 + 1024
                                                     = 25600
        plus one = 0b00000000 00000000 00011001 00000000 = 256 + 1024 + 2048 = 3328
        invert sign = -3328
        b << a y8elds -3328
    a | 0b11111111 11111111 10011100 00000000 & -25
    now, the & is evaluated
        0b11111111 11111111 10011100 00000000
    &   0b11111111 11111111 11111111 11100111
    =   0b11111111 11111111 10011100 00000000

    finally, the | is evaluated against this result.
        0b00000000 00000000 00000000 00001010
    |   0b11111111 11111111 10011100 00000000
        0b11111111 11111111 10011100 00001010
    convert this back to decimal by:
        flip = 0b00000000 00000000 01100011 11110101
        add 1 = 0b00000000 00000000 0110001111110110 = 25590
        invert sign = -25590
    -25590 (phew!)

* a > c && ++a > b

    precedence of ops:
        1. ++a
        2. >
        3. &&
    ++a is evaluated first
        a = 10 before anything else
        a is incremented to 11 before it is evaluated in the next op
            the opposite is true if the increment operator is after the variable
    a > c && 11 > b
    a > c is next
        a = 11
        c = 0
        11 > 0 is true
        1
    11 > b is next
        b = -25
        11 > -25 is true
        1
    1 && 1 is true
        1

* ! ~ b++
    precedence:
        1. postfix increment (b++)
        2. logical not (!)
        3. bitwise not/ones compliment (~)
    b++ is evaluated first
        b = -25
        -25 ; b is incremented to -24
    ~ -25 is next
        0b11111111 11111111 11111111 11100111
    ~   0b00000000 00000000 00000000 00011000
    !  0b00000000 00000000 00000000 00011000 evaluates to 0 since all values
    besides 0 are true and thus evaluate to int 1.
    0

* b++ & a <= 30
    precedence:
        1. postfix increment (b++)
        2. <=
        3. &
    b++ is evaluated first
        b = -25
        -25 ; b is incremented to -24
    a <= 30 is next
        a = 10
        10 <= 30 is true
        1
    -25 & 1 is next
        -25 = 0b11111111 11111111 11111111 11100111
        1   = 0b00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001
        &   = 0b00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001
        1
    1
* a-b, c +=d, e - c
    precedence:
        1. subtraction and addition are tied
        2. unary increment assignment
        3. comma ; only returns the value of the last expression
    a - b is first
        a = 10
        b = -25
        10 - (-25) = 35
    c += d is next
        c = 0
        d = 3
        c += d = 3 ; assigns 3 to c
    e - c is next
        e = 20
        c = 3
        20 - 3 = 17
    only the last expression is returned, so the result is 17.

* a >>= 3 > 0
    **tricky! here's the rule for compound assignment:
    a op= b is equivalent to a = a op (b) ; so the expression b gets evaluated
    first!

    expand the compound assignment thus:

    a = a >> (3 > 0)
    precedence:
        ()
        >
        >>
    3 > 0
        1
    reduces to:
    a = a >> 1
        a = 1010
        a >> 1 = 0101
    5

* a <<= d > 20 ? b && c++ : d--
    ternary operators take the form:
    (expression1) ? (expression2) : (expression3)
        expression1 is evaluated first
            if true, expression2 is evaluated
            else, expression3 is evaluated
    if we expand the conditional expression:
        (a <<= d > 20)
        (a = a << (d > 20))
        a = a << (d > 20)
        precedence here:
            1. ()
            2. <<
            3. =
        d > 20 is evaluated first
            d = 3
            3 > 20 is false
            0
        a = a << 0
            a = 10
            a << 0 = 10
        10 ; a is assigned the value 10, so it is unchanged.
    phew! now we have:
    10 ? b && c++ : d--
    10 is true, so the expression reduces to:
    b && c++
        precedence:
            1. &&
            2. postfix increment (c is only incremented after the expression `b && c++`
            is evaluated.)
        b && c
            -25 && 0
            0 ; c is incremented after this expression is evaluated
        0
    0 ; is apparently **incorrect?!**
    let's try again from the top.

    a <<= d > 20
    a = a << (d) > 20 ;maybe this is correct since (d > 20) is not in
    parentheses, so the compiler probably evaluates the expression as (d), since
    it encounters whitespace before the > operator.
    a = a << 3 > 20
        now precedence is
            1. <<
            2. >
            3. =
    a << 3 is evaluated first
        a = 10
        a << 3 = 10 << 3 = 1010 000 = 80 ; this is apparently the answer?
    a = 80 > 20
        80 > 20 is true
        1 ; a is assigned the value 1
    1 ? b && c++ : d--
    1 is true, so the expression reduces to:
    b && c++
        -25 && 0
        0 ; c is incremented after this expression is evaluated

    okay, last try...
    a <<= d > 20 ? b && c++ : d--
    (maybe?) expands to:
    a = a << (d > 20 ? b && c++ : d--) ; my justification for this? the
        author gives the definition of the compound assignment operator as
        a += expression    is equivalent to    a = a + (expression)
        so, the expression is evaluated first, then the compound assignment is
        evaluated.
    now the parentheses get evaluated.
    d > 20 ? b && c++ : d--
    d > 20 is evaluated first
        d = 3
        3 > 20 is false
        0 -> goto d--
    d-- is evaluated next
        d = 3
        d-- yields the value of d before it is decremented
        3 ; d is decremented to 2
    now we have:
    a = a << 3
    a << 3
        a = 10
        a << 3 = 10 << 3 = 1010 000 = 80
    finally... a = 80
        80 ; a is assigned the value 80

    ...I wonder how much of that kind of stuff I can expect to encounter IRL?

11. Determine how each expression is being evaluated. remove as many parens as
    possible without changing semantics.

```c
a + (b / c)
(a + b) / c
(a * b) % 6
a * (b % 6)

~(a++)
((a == 2) || (a == 4)) && ((b == 2) || (b == 4))
(a & b) ^ (a | b)
(a + (b + c))
```

* a + b / c is semantically equivalent since `/` has higher precedence.

            10 + 3 = 13
    b << 13
              b = 1..11001
        b << 13 = 11111111 11111111 00100000 00000000
    (undefined - 3) < (some negative int)
    undefined < some negative int
    undefined? ; not sure what's up with this one. text says it's
               ; ambiguous/system dependent.

* ~(a++)
    (a++)
        a = 10
        10 ; a is then incremented to 11
    ~10 = 1..1 0101
        = -1 - 2 - 8 = -11
    -11
* ((a == 2) || (a == 4)) && ((b == 2) || (b == 4))
    precedence:
        ||, &&
        ==
    need all parens to maintain semantics.
    (0 || 0) && (...)
    0
* (a & b) ^ (a | b)
    precedence of ops:
        &
        ^
        |
    looks like a & b ^ (a | b) is the same
    a & b
        1001
      & 1010
        1000
    a | b
        1010
        1001
     1..1011
    a & b ^ 1..1011
    0..1000 ^ 1..1011
        1..0011
        -1 - 8 - 4
    -13
* (a + (b + c)) ; thank fuck
    addition is commutatitve, so a + b + c = c + b + a
        i guess there are some diffs between whether the int is signed/unsigned,
        long/doube, whatever...

12. how to determine whether a right shift of a signed value is performed on
    your machine as an arithmetic or logical shift?

    from github copi:

    To determine whether a right shift of a signed value is performed as an arithmetic or logical shift on your machine, you can use a simple test in C or C++.

    Here's a simple C code snippet that can help you determine this:

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
        int x = -1;
        if (x >> 1 == -1)
            printf("Arithmetic shift\n");
        else
            printf("Logical shift\n");
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    This program works by right-shifting the value -1. If the result is still -1, then your machine performs an arithmetic right shift (preserving the sign bit). If the result is a large positive number (due to zeros being shifted in), then your machine performs a logical right shift.

    Compile and run this program on your machine to see the result.

    good enough for me.
