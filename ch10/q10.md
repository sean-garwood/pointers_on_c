# Chapter 10 questions

1. How are structure members different from array elements?

    One main difference is that the structure members can be of different types, whereas this is not true for arrays. Its members are accessed by name rather than index.

1. How is a structure name different from an array name?

    Structure names are not replaced with a pointer when used in an expression, so they are not implicitly passed by reference when used in an arg to a function, for instance; their address must be referenced explicitly in those scenarios

1. The syntax for structure declarations shows some optional components. List all the legal forms of a structure declaration, and explain what is accomplished by each.

    Structures are declared by listing the members they will contain. This list includes the type and name of each member.

    `struct tag { member-list } variable-list;`

    the `tag` attribute allows referencing a structure by its tag.

    the `variable-list` attribute lists all variables that are instances of the structure defined.

    type 1:

    ```c
    struct PERSON {  // this struct uses the tag `PERSON` and creates an instance
      int age;       // variable `sean`.
      char name[MAXNAME];
    } sean;
    ```

    ```c
    struct PERSON {  // this struct uses the tag `PERSON`, but doesn't create an
      int age;       // instance variable.
      char name[MAXNAME];
    };
    ```

    ```c
    struct {         // this struct uses neither the tag nor the variable list 
      int age;       // attributes, but it is legal nonetheless.
      char name[MAXNAME];
    };
    ```

1. What, if anything, is wrong with this program fragment?

    ```c
    struct abc {
      int a;
      int b;
      int c;
    };

    // some code...

    abc.a = 25;
    abc.b = 15;
    abc.c = -1;
    ```

    the code is assigning values to the structure type `abc`, not a particular instance of it. To store the ints into the a, b, and c ints of abc, we would need to first create an instance of the structure and store the values in its members, eg

    ```c
    struct abc some_abc;

    some_abc.a = 25 //etc
    ```

1. What (if anything) is wrong with the following code fragment?

    ```c
    typedef struct {
      int a;
      int b;
      int c;
    } abc;
    // some code
    abc.a = 25;
    abc.b = 15;
    abc.c = -1;
    ```

    The code seems to use `abc` as a structure tag and a variable list, which is
    incorrect.
    * `typedef  struct { ... } abc;` creates an alias `abc` for the anonymous
      structure. After this declaration, `abc` can be used as a type name to
      declare variables of this structure type.
    * the lines attempting to assign values to the members are incorrect because
      `abc` is a type, not a variable.

1. Complete the following declaration to initialize x so that a is three, b is 'hello' and c is 0. assume x is stored in static memory.

    ```c
    struct {
     int a;
     char b[10];
     float c;
    } x = /*answer: */ {3, "hello", 0.0};
    ```

1. Consider the following:

    ```c
    struct NODE {
      int a;
      struct NODE *b;
      struct NODE *c;
    };

    struct NODE nodes[5] = {
      {5, nodes + 3, NULL},
      {15, nodes + 4, nodes + 3},
      {22, NULL, nodes + 4},
      {12, nodes + 1, nodes},
      {18, nodes + 2, nodes + 1}
    };
    // more declarations
    struct NODE *np = nodes + 2;
    struct NODE **npp = &nodes[1].b;
    ```

    Evaluate the following expressions and state their values. Also, state any
    side effects that occur when the expression is evaluated. Evaluate each exp
    with values shown; assume the program is run once per expression. Assume
    `nodes` array begins at location 200 and ints and pointers occupy four bytes.

    | Expression       |           Value          |
    |------------------|--------------------------|
    | `nodes`          |          200             |
    | `nodes.a`        |        illegal           |
    | `nodes[3].a`     |          12              |
    | `nodes[3].c`     |          200             |
    | `nodes[3].c->a`  |          5               |
    | `*nodes`         |  {5, nodes + 3, NULL}    |
    | `*nodes.a`       |        illegal           |
    | `(*nodes).a`     |          5               |
    | `nodes->a`       |          5               |
    | `nodes[3].b->b`  |          248             |
    | `*nodes[3].b->b` |{18, nodes + 2, nodes + 1}|
    | `&nodes`         |          200             |
    | `&nodes[3].a`    |          236             |
    | `&nodes[3].c`    |          244             |
    | `&nodes[3].c->a` |          200             |
    | `&nodes->a`      |          200             |
    | `np`             |          224             |
    | `np->a`          |          22              |
    | `np->c->c->a`    |          15              |
    | `npp`            |          216             |
    | `npp->a`         |        illegal           |
    | `*npp`           |          248             |
    | `**npp`          |{18, nodes + 2, nodes + 1}|
    | `*npp->a`        |        illegal           |
    | `(*npp)->a`      |          18              |
    | `&np`            |         undef            |
    | `&np->a`         |          224             |
    | `&np->c->c->a`   |          212             |

1. How much space is wasted in the following structure:

    ```c
    struct {
     char a;
     int b;
     char c;
    }
    ```

    ...due to boundary alignment on a machine...

    * with 16-bit integers? chars take one byte, ints 2, so 2 bytes are wasted (6
  used instead of 4)
    * with 32-bit integers? chars still take one byte, ints 4, so 6 bytes are wasted

1. name at least two reasons why bit field declarations are not portable.

    * microprocessor architectures differ between machines
    * size of 'words' differ between machines
    * compiler implementations of bit fields can vary, leading to differences in alignment and padding
    * endianness differences between systems can affect how bit fields are stored and accessed
    * the behavior of bit fields when used with signed types is not consistently defined across different compilers

1. Write a declaration that allows easy access to the individual parts of a
   floating-point in the following format:

    * sign: 1 bit (leftmost)
    * exponent: 7 bits
    * fraction: 24 bits (rightmost)

    ```c
    typedef struct {
    unsigned int fraction : 24;
    unsigned int exponent : 7;
    unsigned int sign     : 1;
    } FloatingPointParts;
    ```

1. How would you accomplish the same result as the following code without using
   bit fields? Assume you have a 16-bit machine that allocates bit fields from
   left to right.

    ```c
    struct {
      int a:4;
      int b:8;
      int c:3;
      int d:1;
    } x;
    // some code
    x.a = aaa;
    x.b = bbb;
    x.c = ccc;
    x.d = ddd;
    ```

    I had to look up the answer to this one. From the author:

    `x` should be declared an int or an unsigned int, and masking and shifting
    are used to store the proper values. Translating each statement individually
    gives this code:

    ```c
    x &= 0x0fff;
    x |= (aaa & 0xf) << 12;
    x &= 0xf00f;
    x |= (bbb & 0xff) << 4;
    x &= 0xfff1;
    x |= (ccc & 0x7) << 1;
    x &= 0xfffe;
    x |= (ddd & 0x1);
    ```

1. What does the following code print?

    ```c
    struct {
      int a:2;
    } x;
    // ...
    x.a = 1;
    x.a += 1;
    printf("%d\n", x.a);
    ```

    struct member a is defined as a signed integer bit field with a width of 2

    after `x.a = 1;` we have `b01`. then, if we add 1 to this, we get `b10`.
    Assuming this is a two's complement representation, we have -2, which is
    printed.

1. What, if anything, is wrong with this code?

    ```c
    union {
      int a;
      float b;
      char c;
    } x;

    // ...
    x.a = 25;
    x.b = 3.14;
    x.c = 'x';
    printf("%d %g %c\n", x.a, x.b, x.c);
    ```

    the union occupies one 32-bit word (on modern machines). therefore, the
    assignment x.a is overwritten when x.b is declared, and the last eight bits
    of  x.b is overwritten when x.c is declared, since 8 bits is the size of a
    char in c. `x` is 120, so this is stored in the least-significant 8 bits of
    the 32-bit field at &x.

    The int, float, and char representations of this data will be printed, but
    only the last of these will be accurate. Here's the output on my machine:

    1078523256 3.13998 x

1. Suppose some info has been assigned to a union variable. How can this
   information be retrieved?

    The dot operator `.` will retrieve the data in the union variable for the
    given member following the operator, like shown above. The value stored in
    the union variable will be interpreted depending upon the type of its member
    that is given in its initialization.

1. The following struct could be used by a BASIC interpreter to keep track of
   the type and value of variables:

    ```c
    struct VARIABLE {
      enum {INT, FLOAT, STRING} type;
      union {
        int i;
        float f;
        char *s;
      } value;
    };
    ```

    What would be different if this were used instead?

    ```c
    struct VARIABLE {
      enum {INT, FLOAT, STRING} type;
      union {
        int i;
        float f;
        char s[MAXLEN];
      } value;
    };
    ```

    The only difference is the way in which the member `s` is defined in the
    embedded union. in the first instance, it is defined as a pointer to a
    character. In the latter, it is defined as a character array of length
    MAXLEN.

    The size of a union is determined by the size of its largest element. In the
    former case, this is 64 bits, since the size of a char pointer is 64 bits (on
    my machine, at least).

    In the latter case, if MAXLEN == 8, then the structs are identical. Else, if
    4 < MAXLEN < 8 || MAXLEN > 8, the union size is MAXLEN.
