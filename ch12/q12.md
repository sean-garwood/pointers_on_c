# Chapter 12 questions

1. can `sll_insert` in [q12.c](./q12.c) be rewritten without using a `current` variable? If so,
   compare the resulting function.

   yes, current is just a pointer to a node. it is set to `*linkp`, which is a
   pointer to a pointer to a register Node.

   I rewrote the unction in [q12.c](./q12.c) as `rewritten_sll_insert`.

1. Some suggest using a 'header node' in a singly-linked list. this dummy node
   is always the first element in the list and eliminates the special case code
   for inserting at the beginning of the list.

   Pros?

   - less cognitive overhead
   - less error-prone
   - less special cases
   - less bugs
   - less testing
   - less maintenance
   - less documentation
   - less training
   - less support
   - less cost
   - less time
   - less effort
   - less frustration
   - less confusion

   Cons?

   - more memory
   - more complexity
   - more overhead
   - more code

1. Where would the insertion function in `sll_insert` put a node with a
   duplicate value? What would be the effect of changing the comparison from `<`
   to `<=`?

   `sll_insert` would put a node with a duplicate value before the original node
   with the same value. Changing the comparison to `<=` would put the new node
   after the original node with the same value, because the body of the while
   loop would execute. This would set `linkp` to the address of the `next`
   pointer of the `current` node, which is the one with the same value as
   `new_value`.

1. discuss techniques for removing the value fied from the root node of a doubly
   linked list.

   To remove the value field from the root node of a doubly linked list, the
   list would be initialized with a dummy node that would be the first element
   with null value. It would point to the tail node, which would also have a
   null value.

   One approach is to insert a node at the beginning of the list: HEAD. It would
   point to the first node in the list.

    Another approach is to insert a node at the end of the list: TAIL. It would
    point to the last node in the list.

    The HEAD and TAIL nodes would be initialized with a null value. The HEAD
    If the list is empty, HEAD points to TAIL, which points to NULL.

   The author's answer:

     If the root node were dynamically allocated, the objective could be
     achieved by not allocating the complete node:

     ```c
     Node *root;
     root = malloc(sizeof(Node) - sizeof(value_t));

     // A safer approach is to declare a struct that contains just pointers.

      struct DLL_NODE;

      struct DLL_POINTERS
      {
          struct DLL_NODE *next;
          struct DLL_NODE *prev;
      };

      struct DLL_NODE
      {
          struct DLL_POINTERS ptrs;
          value_t value;
      };
     ```

     Not sure what he means.

1. What's the result of allocating memory for a new node in an insert function
   before checking for errors, duplicates, etc?

   In `sll_insert`, memory allocation for the new node (`new`) occurs after the loop that finds the correct insertion point. This means that if the program runs out of memory (`malloc` returns `NULL`), the function returns `FALSE` without modifying the linked list. This approach ensures that the function only attempts to allocate memory when necessary, potentially avoiding unnecessary memory allocation if an error occurs early.

   In contrast, `alloc_first_then_insert` allocates memory for the new node at the beginning of the function, before the loop to find the insertion point. This has a couple of implications:

   **Memory Allocation Before Insertion Point Determination**: Memory for the new node is allocated regardless of where in the list the new value will be inserted. This could lead to a situation where memory is allocated unnecessarily if, for example, an error occurs before the insertion point is found or if the insertion criteria change in the future.

   **Potential Memory Leak**: If the memory allocation is successful but the function returns `FALSE` for some reason after the allocation (not shown in the current implementation but could be a consideration for future modifications), there's a risk of a memory leak because the allocated memory is not freed.

   **Memory Allocation Timing**: `sll_insert` allocates memory only when
    necessary, after finding the insertion point, whereas
    `alloc_first_then_insert` allocates memory at the beginning.

   **Error Handling and Resource Management**: `sll_insert` is slightly more
   efficient in terms of memory usage because it only allocates memory when it's
   certain the insertion will proceed. `alloc_first_then_insert` could
   potentially waste resources by allocating memory that might not be used,
   leading to a memory leak if not handled properly.

1. Is it possible to sort the nodes in an unordered, singly linked list?

   Yes, of course! You can sort the nodes in an unordered, singly linked list by
   inserting the nodes in a sorted order. The sll_insert function does exactly
   that. It inserts the new node in the correct position in the linked list so
   that the list remains sorted.

   ```c
   void *sort_unordered_sll(register Node **linkp)
   {
       register Node *current;
       register Node *new;
       register Node *sorted = NULL;
   
       while ((current = *linkp) != NULL)
       {
           new = current;
           current = current->next;
           sll_insert(&sorted, new->data);
       }
       return sorted;
   }
   ```

1. A *concordance list* is an alphabetic list of the words that appear in a book
   or article; an index. It can be implemented using an ordered, singly linked
   list of strings with an insertion function that does not add duplicate words
   to the list.

   The problem with this implementation is that the time it takes to search the
   list increases as the list grows insize.

   To reduce complexity, the large list is broken into smaller buckets, e.g. 26
   for each letter of the alphabet.

   How does this reduce the complexity?

   In the best case, it goes from O(n) to O(1). for instance, if i'm looking for
   zebra, and my ordered sll has hundreds of thousands of words, but the only
   one beginning with z is zebra, then i jsut did it in 1 cycle.

   Worst case, it does nothing. This occurs when all words begin with the same
   letter.
