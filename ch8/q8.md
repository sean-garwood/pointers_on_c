# Questions - Chapter 8

1. given declarations and data below, evaluate each exp and state its value.

    evaluate each exp with original data shown (the results of one expression do not
    affect the following ones).

    Assume that the `ints` array begins at location 100 and that ints and ptrs
    occupy four bytes.

    ```c
    int ints[20] = {
        10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100,
        110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200
    };

    // other declarations

    int *ip = ints + 3; // ip is a pointer to an integer (address of `ints[3]`)
    ```
    ints
        value is pointer to int at the start of `ints` array.
        100
    ints[4]
        50
    ints + 4
        address of the fourth element in `ints`
        100 + 4 * 4 = 116
    *ints + 4
        10 + 4
        14
    *(ints + 4)
        50
    ints[-2]
        same as *(ints - 2)
        *(100 - (4 * 2))
        *(92)
        undefined/unknown
    &ints
        address **entire** array `ints`
            diff type than `ints`, which is address of first int in `ints`.
        100 (scaled by sizeof ints)
    &ints[4]
        &(ints[4])
        &(*(ints + 4))
        &(*(100 + 16))
        &(50)
        116
    &ints + 4
        420
    &ints[-2]
        &(*(ints - 2))
        undefined
    ip
        address of `ints[3]`
        112
    ip[4]
        *(ip + 4)
        *(112 + 16)
        *128 = 80
    ip + 4
        112 + 4 * 4 = 128
    *ip + 4
        40 + 4 = 44
    *(ip + 4)
        *(112 + 4 * 4)
        *128 = 80
    ip[-2]
        *(ip - 2)
        *(112 - 2 * 4)
        *(104) = 20
    &ip
        undefined -- we don't know where the compiler put `ip`
    &ip[4]
        128
    &ip + 4
        undefined
    &ip[-2]
        104

2. `arr[i+j] == i + j[arr]`?
    `j[arr] == arr[j]`, so is `arr[i + j] == i + arr[j]`
    `i + arr[j]` is the same as `i + *(arr + j)`
    `arr[i + j]` is the same as `*(arr + (i + j))`
    i + *(arr + j)          *(arr + (i + j))
    no. i is added to the result of arr[j] in the second instance, whereas
    arr[i+j] returns the value at i+j

3. will the following access `data` at the correct subscripts?

```c

#include <stdio.h>

int actual_data[20];
int *data = actual_data - 1;

// some dumy data
int main(void)
{
    printf("actual: %d", data[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

yep, it works.

4. rewrite this to use pointers

```c
char buffer[SIZE];
int front, rear;
front = 0;
rear = strlen(buffer) - 1;
while (front < rear)
{
    if (buffer[front] != buffer[rear])
        break;

    front += 1;
    rear -= 1;
}
if (front >= rear)
    printf("it's a palindrome!\n");
```

see [attached](./buffer/buffer.c)

5. better to sacrifice efficiency for maintainability, so it's reasonable to use
   subscripts whenever they increase maintainability.

6. skipped

7. skipped

8. given

```c
//1.c
int a[10];
int *b = a;
```

and

```c
//2.c
extern int *a;
extern int b[];
int x, y;
// some code
x = a[3];
y = b[3];
```

Explain what happens when two assignment stmts are executed, assuming ints and
pointers both occupy four bytes.

the statements are executed in 2.c. `*a` is a pointer to an external int array.
The expression `x = a[3]` dereferences this pointer three memory slots up from
a[0], so the value there is stored in x.

in 2.c, `b[]` is declared as an array of external ints.

9. Write a declaration that will init an array of ints called `coin_values` to
   the values of current U.S. coins.

`int coins[] = {1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100}; //value in cents`

10. given the declaration `int array[4][2];` give the value of the following
    expressions, assuming `&array[0][0] == 1000` and that ints occupy two bytes
    of memory.

&array[0][0] == 1000
&array[0][1] == 1002
&array[0][2] == 1004
&array[1][0] == 1006


array
    1000
array + 2
    1012 (first element of the 2th array)
array[3]
    1016 (first element of the 3th array)
array[2] - 1
    *(array + 2) - 1
    value stored at last element of 1th array
&array[1][2]
    Address of the 2th elemnt of the 1th array

&array[2][0]
    Address of the 0th element of the 2th array.

11. Given the declaration
    `int array[4][2][3][6];`
 compute the value of each of the following exps. Show the declaration that would be needed for the var
    `x` in order for teh exp to be assigned to x without using a cast. Assume
    that the array begins at loc 1000 and that ints occupy four bytes of mem.

array
    value: 1000
    int x = ***array[0]
array + 2
    same as array[2]
    pointer to the 3rd array , which is itself an array of two elements, which
    is itself an array of three elements, each of which are an array of six
    integers.

    each array is length x 2 bytes
    2 * 2 + 3 * 2 + 6 * 2 = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 + 1000 = 1022 puts at first array
    1044 == &array[2][0][0][0]
    int (*x)[]
array[3]
    array[3]...
    or ***array[3]
    1066 (see above)
array[2] - 1
    * (array + 2) - 1
    ^ points to array of size 2 * 2 + 3 * 2 + 6 * 2 = 22
    scale back by this size
    array[1]
array[2][1]
    *(array + 2)[1]
    ^ points to 2th element of arrays, which is of size 18
array[1][0] + 1
    array[1][1][0][0]
array[1][0][2]
    array[1][0][2][0]
array[0][1][0] + 2
array[3][1][2][5]
&array[3][1][2][5]
